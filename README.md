This is a little project to practice using rust. I wanted to get stuck into something that maps ML learning and more involved rust than just writing functions to use with Pyo3. The idea was to implement a simple neural network for classification and implement back-propagation by hand.

I learned some interesting things about rust and about the backpropogation algorithm.

The code leans on the ndarray crate which is akin to numpy in python (though not nearly as mature).
